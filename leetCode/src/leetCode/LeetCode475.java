/**
 * Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard
 * heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
 * 
 * Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find
 * out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those
 * heaters.
 * 
 * So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and
 * your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
